Emojifier AI: Transform Text into Emoji-rich Sentences

Emojifier AI is an interactive Python-based application that converts text into a sentence enhanced with relevant emojis. It analyzes the sentiment of the input text using VADER sentiment analysis and assigns appropriate emojis based on the sentiment score. Additionally, it includes a lexical mapping of common words and phrases to their corresponding emojis, providing a fun and engaging way to express emotions, activities, and concepts.

### Key Features:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The program evaluates the sentiment of your input text and appends an emoji to reflect the mood (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).
- **Word-to-Emoji Mapping**: Common words and phrases are automatically replaced with emojis (e.g., "love" becomes "‚ù§Ô∏è", "food" becomes "üçîüçï").
- **User Interaction**: The program allows users to enter any text, and it responds with an emoji-enhanced version of the sentence.

### How it Works:
1. **Input**: You enter a sentence or phrase.
2. **Analysis**: The program checks the sentiment of your text (positive, negative, or neutral).
3. **Emoji Transformation**: The program replaces words from its predefined lexicon with emojis and adds a sentiment-based emoji at the end.
4. **Output**: A transformed sentence appears with emojis reflecting the mood and words from the sentence.

### Example:
- **Input**: "I love coding and playing games."
- **Output**: "I ‚ù§Ô∏è coding and playing games üéÆ"

This tool is perfect for adding fun to messages, social media posts, or any form of communication where you want to convey emotions with a splash of color!
